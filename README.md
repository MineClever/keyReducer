Have you ever had to deal with baked curves and spent way too much time in cleaning them? Or felt you were dealing with curves with too many unnecessary keyframes?

Better curves are just one drag away!

* Works on selected objects
* Reduce keys of your animation curves preserving their shapes
* Works on multiple curves at once
* Curves selection from Graph Editor and Channel Box
* Frame range selection for local control over keys reduction
* Pre Bake mode converts weighted curves into non-weighted, it fixes all your broken tangents too.
